    "In a distant, war-torn land, there are ten castles. There are two warlords: you and your archenemy. Each castle has its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror. Specifically, the castles are worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9, and 10 victory points (corresponding to the castle number). You and your enemy each have 100 soldiers to distribute, any way you like, to fight at any of the ten castles. Whoever sends more soldiers to a given castle conquers that castle and wins its victory points. If you each send the same number of troops, you split the points. You don’t know what distribution of forces your enemy has chosen until the battles begin. Whoever wins the most points wins the war.\n",

Magic commands come in two flavors: line magics, which are denoted by a single `%` prefix and operate on a single line of input, and cell magics, which are denoted by a double `%%` prefix and operate on multiple lines of input. We'll demonstrate and discuss a few brief examples here, and come back to more focused discussion of several useful magic commands later in the chapter.\n",

For multi line statements, adding a second `%` sign will turn this into a cell magic that can handle multiple lines of input. For example, here's the equivalent construction with a for-loop:\n",
